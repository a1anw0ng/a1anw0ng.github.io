entry point:
	main()

Best way to see the scope's of variables are through debugger:

Debugger runs the same path as a normal program running, except that
	Normal run is very fast
	Debugger slows it down, you could set break points to stop the running of a program
        to check on the variable in that line and the scoping variables in that line.

Actions for Debugger:
	Set break point at a line
	start debug: F11
	Step-over: F6
	Step-in: F5
	Resume (or continue the running): F8
	Terminate: Ctrl+F2

===========================
Singleton:

In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
