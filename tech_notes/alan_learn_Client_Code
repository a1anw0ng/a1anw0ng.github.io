1. Get a basic html templete:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	    <body>
	    </body>
	</html>

2. Get a button example from w3schools.com; with function call:
	<input type="button" onclick="useAxiosToCallServer()" value="GET">

3. Get a function example from Javascript in w3schools:
        <script>
            function useAxiosToCallServer() {
              console.log("HI ALan!")
            }
        </script>

4. To test, and see if the function work in Chrome's Inspect
	To see it in Console tab

5. To include a library or package of Axios into the HTML:
	<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/0.19.0/axios.min.js"></script>

6. Need to find out the server is up and run for me to call:
	https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

7. Get some example from https://axios-http.com/
        axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
        .then(res => {
            //if successful, run this block
	    console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data))
        }).catch(err => {
            //if fails, run this block
            console.error(err)
        });
	
	# axios -- it is a class object
	# axios.get -- it is a method of axios class-object; and also the GET method of restful API calls
	# https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com  -- it is the 3rd party web server 
	# /todos  -- it is the restful api entry-point (or the cloud-function that you are calling)
	# Because of the strange code looking, you known it is a asynchronous-codes.
        # When you see: .then()  -- it means it is a Promise asynchronous call
	# Promise -- means the system will take care of your asynchronous call, and promise to return you
	             with Success or Failure
	# res -- it is class-object of the response-object; which mean whatever the successful result you got from the web-server
	# err -- it is class-object of the response-object, but, it is for failure.
	# console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data)) -- to print the received data from webserver in string format


8. Now, all the codes needed:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <input type="button" onclick="useAxiosToCallServer()" value="GET">
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/axios/0.19.0/axios.min.js"></script>
        <script>
            function useAxiosToCallServer() {
                axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
                .then(res => {
                    //if successful, run this block
                    console.log(JSON.stringify(res.data))
                }).catch(err => {
                    //if fails, run this block
                    console.error(err)
                });
            }
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
